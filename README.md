    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Patrick Michael Lannan and I was born in the Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton. I was born here, and I have lived here ever since. Ever since I was a child barely able to walk, I have had an obsession with baseball. I played it all the time as I grew up, and played baseball video games as well. Sadly after my team won the championship back at West Junior High, I haven't played since. I wanted to come back to it but it just never worked out. I just recently got a job at Sears, and I also try to get to the gym a few times a week, even though I have been slacking off recently. Obviously my favorite sport is <a href="https://www.mlb.com">Baseball</a>, but I also watch sports. I always make sure I check the <a href="https://www.patriots.com">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.nhl.com/bruins">The Boston Bruins</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox">The Boston Red Sox</a> games. My absolute favorite thing to do though is play video games. My favorite show is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eric_Andre_Show">The Eric Andre Show</a>.</p>   
    <h2>Family</h2> 
    <p>I grew up in a family of five; my father, mother, brother, and sister. I am the youngest by far as my brother is six years older than me, and my sister is ten years older than me. My dad works at <a href="https://www.seracare.com">Sera care</a> and works with blood, especially infected blood, and contains it/and or ships it. No one has moved out yet, but my brother is working at <a href="https://www.repligen.com">Repligen</a> after graduating at <a href="https://www.uml.edu">U Mass Lowell</a> with a chemical engineering degree. My sister isn't really doing too much.</p>
